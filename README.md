# Drone Security and the Mysterious Case of DroneID - Adapted Project

Welcome to the repository for the **first project of the CYBERPHYSICAL AND IoT SECURITY course (2024-2025)**. This project is an adaptation based on the research paper **"Drone Security and the Mysterious Case of DJI’s DroneID"**, implemented on a low-cost Chinese drone.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze drone communication security by reinterpreting the DroneID concept in a more accessible hardware platform. The work includes the development of a simulated Remote Controller (RC), network traffic analysis, and comprehensive documentation of the implementation process.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

### `/src`
Contains all the code developed for simulating the Remote Controller (RC). This includes:
- Implementation of communication protocols.
- Control and interaction logic for the drone.

### `/pcap`
Holds the packet capture (PCAP) files generated during the sniffing process. These files provide insights into the drone’s communication patterns and can be used for further analysis.

### `/doc`
This folder includes:
- **LaTeX documentation**: Detailed write-up of the project, including methodology, findings, and references.
- **Compiled PDF**: Ready-to-read version of the documentation for quick access.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/AndreaSignori/CP-IOTSecurity-Hacking-Chinese-Drone-for-Fun-and-30L/blob/main/README.md]
   ```
2. Navigate to the respective folders to explore the code, packet captures, or documentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.7 for running the simulation scripts.
- Wireshark or any other PCAP file analyzer for examining the sniffed data.
- LaTeX distribution for recompiling the documentation (optional).

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to enhance this project. Feel free to submit pull requests or report issues in the repository’s issue tracker.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the authors of the original paper **"Drone Security and the Mysterious Case of DJI’s DroneID"**, whose work served as the inspiration for this project.
