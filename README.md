Welcome to the Cyberphysical and IoT Security Course Repository!

This repository contains all the materials, tools, and outcomes related to the first project of the Cyberphysical and IoT Security course. The project focuses on adapting and implementing key concepts from the paper "Drone Security and the Mysterious Case of DJI’s DroneID" in a practical scenario using a Chinese-manufactured drone.

Our work aims to analyze and extend the findings of the original research, applying them to a new platform while exploring security challenges specific to drone ecosystems. You’ll find:

    Research materials: Summaries, analyses, and insights from the original paper.
    Implementation details: Code, configurations, and methodologies applied during the project.
    Experimental results: Observations and conclusions drawn from testing on the target drone.
    Documentation: Comprehensive guides and explanations to ensure reproducibility and clarity.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, student, or simply interested in drone security, this repository provides a detailed look into the project and its outcomes
